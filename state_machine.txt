
(1) keep lane -> follow max speed

if: there is a car ahead
 (2) copy velocity (always below the maximum)
 if distance buffer is too big -> back to (1)
 if distance buffer is too low -> reduce speed
 else:
	(3) change libre
		if left lane is free => new lane = left
		else if right lane is free => new lane = right
		else: keep in (2) and check again
